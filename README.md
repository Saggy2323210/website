# SSGMCE College Website

Full-stack college website for Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj College of Engineering (SSGMCE), Shegaon.
It includes a public-facing site and an admin CMS with markdown-based content editing.

## Developed By

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gauravghatol/website.git
cd website
```

Use Node.js `20.19.0` or newer compatible with Vite 7 (`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`).

### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

### 3. Start Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` and proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to backend.

## Environment Variables

Create `server/.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
MONGODB_DIRECT_URI=<optional-non-srv-mongodb-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret-at-least-32-characters>
AUTH_COOKIE_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOOPBACK=true
ADMIN_GATE_TOKEN=<strong-random-admin-entry-token>
```

If `mongodb+srv://...` fails locally with a `querySrv ECONNREFUSED` error, use the standard Atlas connection string in `MONGODB_DIRECT_URI` as a fallback. If Atlas says your machine is not allowed to connect, add your current IP address under Atlas Network Access first.

For non-loopback staging or test URLs, use HTTPS and set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`. The server only allows insecure auth cookies by default for localhost/127.0.0.1 development so Docker/LAN HTTP targets do not accidentally receive reusable session cookies.

## Core Features

- Public website with institution-wide sections
- CMS-driven pages using reusable markdown content blocks
- Admin visual editor for page sections (markdown, image, table, stats, etc.)
- Structured page data seeded from `server/data/allNavPages.js`
- News, notices, events, documents, department and placement modules

## Documentation Set

- [TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md) — full technical architecture and maintenance reference
- [ADMIN_USER_MANUAL.md](ADMIN_USER_MANUAL.md) — non-technical admin panel usage guide
- [MARKDOWN_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md](MARKDOWN_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md) — practical Markdown reference for content editors
- [HANDOVER_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md](HANDOVER_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md) — outgoing/incoming team transfer checklist
- [SECURITY_TESTING_REPORT.md](SECURITY_TESTING_REPORT.md) — security hardening and testing notes

## Security Status

Current local hardening status is documented in [SECURITY_TESTING_REPORT.md](SECURITY_TESTING_REPORT.md).

- Authentication uses HTTP-only JWT cookies; legacy browser `adminToken` storage is purged client-side.
- Admin write routes, document conversion, private document access, and faculty/department mutations are protected server-side.
- Rich text and raw Markdown HTML render paths are sanitized with DOMPurify-based helpers.
- Generated/local secrets and deployment env files are ignored; do not commit `.env`, `server/.env`, `server/.dev-jwt-secret`, or `client/.env.production`.
- Known remaining dependency item: one low-severity indirect `quill@2.0.3` advisory through `react-quill-new`; upgrade when a compatible patched release exists.

## API Overview

All APIs are under `/api`:

- `/api/auth` authentication
- `/api/pages` page content and section updates
- `/api/departments`, `/api/faculty`
- `/api/news`, `/api/notices`, `/api/events`
- `/api/placements`, `/api/research`, `/api/iqac`, `/api/nirf`
- `/api/documents`, `/api/upload`

## Useful Commands

```bash
# client
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview

# server
npm run dev
npm start
npm run check:syntax

# root
npm run verify
```

## Production Checklist

- Use Node from `.nvmrc` (`20.19.0`) or another version matching `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`.
- Set strong production `JWT_SECRET` and `ADMIN_GATE_TOKEN` values in the deployment platform, not in Git.
- Set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` and deploy behind HTTPS for production or shared test environments.
- Set exact production `CORS_ORIGIN` and `VITE_BACKEND_URL` values.
- Run `npm run verify` before release.
- Run server and client audits; the CI workflow fails on moderate-or-higher advisories.
- Complete live testing for login, admin CRUD, uploads/downloads, responsive UI, Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals, and CSP behavior.
- Rotate any credentials that were ever committed and clean Git history before making the repository public.

## Notes

- If frontend shows proxy errors like `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5000`, backend is not running.
- Keep `allNavPages.js` aligned with navbar order so admin page ordering remains consistent.
